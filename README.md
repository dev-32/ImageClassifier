## Introduction

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision, and deep learning models have achieved remarkable performance in this domain. This project demonstrates how to leverage a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Keras to create a robust image classifier. You can use this classifier to classify images into various categories or classes based on the objects or patterns present in them.

## Features

- Uses a pre-trained model for image classification.
- Supports a wide range of image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).
- Easy-to-use command-line interface for predicting images.
- Customizable for different datasets and categories.
- High accuracy and reliability.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Use Google Colab
- We can either use Jupiter Notebook and other IDE's.
```

## Installation

To install and use this image classifier, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dev-32/ImageClassifier.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd ImageClassifier
```

3. Run the installation script:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

To classify an image, you can use the command-line interface as follows:

```bash
python classify_image.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg
```

Replace `path/to/your/image.jpg` with the path to the image you want to classify. The classifier will output the predicted class or category for the image.

You can also customize the classifier for your specific needs by modifying the configuration files and training it on your dataset.

## Contributing
